# Klingelbox

**An open-hardware door intercom: a brass front flush in the facade, an e-paper touch screen,
two-way talk, and one PoE cable. Built on ESP32, ESPHome and Home Assistant. No camera, ever.**

[Deutsch](README.de.md)

> Status: prototype. The parts are on the bench, the front and the box exist as 3D-printed
> prototypes. Nothing is installed at a door yet. State of this page: 24 September 2026.

## What it is

- **A doorbell first.** A plain brass button on a supervised line: idle, pressed and a cut wire
  read as three different voltages, so a broken wire is reported instead of going silent. The
  ring reaches the phone before anything else happens at the door.
- **A screen at the door.** A 4.7" e-paper touch screen behind a window in the brass: greetings,
  notices, a QR code. It keeps its image without power and stays readable in sunlight.
- **Talk.** A microphone and a speaker behind the brass for two-way conversation, relayed
  through Home Assistant to a phone. Planned: voice messages and push-to-talk into the house.
- **One cable.** Data and power arrive over a single outdoor PoE cable. No power supply at the
  door, no switch in the box.
- **Local.** Everything runs on ESPHome and Home Assistant at home.
- **Private by design.** No camera. The microphone only opens after a visitor presses
  something, and the screen says so.

## Explore it

![The explorer: every part of the intercom from the house network through the wall into the box and the brass front, with colour-coded wires](docs/images/explorer.png)

The [explorer](explorer/) is an interactive map of the whole system: switch wire types on and
off, tap any part for what it is and why it was chosen, and follow walkthroughs of a ring, the
power path, winter heating and a call. Download
[`explorer/dist/klingelbox-explorer.html`](explorer/dist/klingelbox-explorer.html) and open it in
a browser. A hosted version is planned.

## How it works

Three small computers share one cable and one 5 V rail, and nothing else:

| Computer | Board | Link | Job |
|---|---|---|---|
| Doorbell | WT32-ETH01 | wired | button line, light, heater, climate sensor |
| Talk | Waveshare ESP32-S3-POE-ETH | WiFi | microphone, amplifier, calls |
| Screen | LilyGO T5-4.7-S3 Touch | WiFi | e-paper touch screen |

The bell runs on its own board with stock ESPHome only, so a crash or an update in the audio code
can never silence it. Details, power budget and the winter heater: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

Firmware (ESPHome YAML) and the Home Assistant automations will be added once they have
passed the bench tests.

## Safety

- The surge protector only protects when it is earthed. That, and anything on 230 V, is a job
  for an electrician.
- The e-paper panel is rated 0 to +50 °C. Outdoors it needs the heater, and the heater needs
  its thermal fuse.
- Never plug a board's USB into a computer while the box's 5 V rail is live, unless the cable
  blocks power.
