# Build log

What happened, in order, including the dead ends. Dates are 2026.

## August: a doorbell that works

- The old doorbell had been dead for a long time: its button's circuit board had died from rain.
- First version: a plain brass button on an existing two-wire cable into an ESP32 indoors,
  running ESPHome, with a push notification through Home Assistant. No chime.
- **Lesson:** a floating input pin on a long cable acts as an antenna. At one point it
  produced 134 phantom rings in 15 minutes. The fix became the supervised line: pull-up,
  series resistor, filter capacitor and an end-of-line resistor at the button, so idle,
  pressed and a cut wire give three different voltages.
- **Lesson:** a component only does something if current can flow *through* it. A resistor
  plugged into an empty breadboard row changed nothing, and only the multimeter showed it.

## 17 September: from doorbell to intercom

- New goal: a small e-paper screen at the door, later speech in both directions.
- **Hard rule from day one: no camera at the door, ever.**
- Front design in five rounds of dimensioned drawings (generated in Python, true scale):
  - v2: portrait screen, one button, speaker grille;
  - v3: flush in the wall, a separate brass roof cap, a cable pipe bending into the wall;
  - v4: back to one folded sheet, with a brass cable pipe rising in front of the wall (rejected);
  - v5: no pipe, 100 × 260 mm, LED band in the fold with a quarter-round diffuser.

## 18 September: CAD

- The front sheet, the in-wall box, a carrier plate and the diffuser modelled in FreeCAD,
  driven by scripts. First prints of the sheet (in two parts, it is taller than the print bed)
  and the box.
- The speaker changed from a 3 W waterproof part to the smaller VISATON K 40 SQ: it is quieter on
  paper (0.5 W) but louder in practice (82 dB vs 74 dB at 1 W / 1 m). Sensitivity beats wattage.

## 24 September: parts, architecture, explorer

- Most parts arrived and were identified (some sold under vague names: an opto-coupled MOSFET
  module turned out to be usable because its optocoupler drives the gate from 12 V).
- Architecture settled:
  - **one** ready-made outdoor PoE cable instead of three cables plus a power cable;
  - three computers: a wired doorbell computer, a talk computer on WiFi, a screen computer
    on WiFi;
  - two-way talk via the community VoIP Stack for ESPHome, with walkie-talkie mode as the
    fallback.
- The [explorer](../explorer/) was built to make the whole system understandable, including
  every wire and every solder joint.

## Next

The plan from here is the [roadmap](roadmap.md): all hardware on the table, measure and
alpha-print the box, build the software on the bench, prove the box can be sealed, then a beta
box on the desk, a pre-release box and finally the door.
